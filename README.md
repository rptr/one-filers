- **xorth.asm**: NASM Forth interpreter. WIP.
- **firth.py**: Toy Forth interpreter (simple arithmetic only)
- **prolog.py**: Prolog interpreter in Python. Does not support lists (etc) and is nowhere near a proper Prolog implementation at 350 LOC. It implements the unification & resolution algorithms  described in The Art of Prolog.
- **my-scheme.rkt**: Scheme interpreter in Racket, pretty much what is described in SICP. Works pretty well, but not very useful.
- **scheme.hs**: This is just a copy-paste of [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours), wanted to try out parsec, and I like Scheme.
- **opaste.sh**: Paste piped data to sprunge.us
- **diary.sh**: bash diary/ note-taking. I use this for quick notes.
- **anna.pl**: Unfinished Perl IRC bot
- **memory.sh**: I believe this is a command line flash card app (like Anki)
- **horse.py**: As below, Python version. I used this for a while but moved back to
LibreOffice Calc :).
- **worse.sh**: "Workhorse", hour logging for freelance work (original bash version, not working(?))
